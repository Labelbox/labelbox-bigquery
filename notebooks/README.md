# Overview

This is a placeholder demo notebook until labelbox-bigquery is a publicly installable SDK. Until then, this notebook will suffice, as the client.py class has been copy/pasted into it. 

# Purpose

This notebook is to facilitate experimentation with the labelbox-bigquery connector. Please share feedback with the Author(s). 

# How to Use It

Download the notebook and read the docstrings to understand each function and how to use them. Please reach out to Labelbox if you have questions or feedback, both of which are highly encouraged.
